- ***2017-08-27* (initial commit)**<br/>
As being inspired by many people, articles, I decide to write my dairy (mostly coding dairy) which tells about my path full of trouble learning new stuff and to remind me not to forget (give up) the things I could have finished if I have tried a bit more.<br/>
An interesting thing is, with the availability of thousands of tools, webs supporting blog and diary writing, after 1 hour of signing up, trying, my decision is this 'low-level' text file and to make it as normal Git project >.<<br/>
Because this is the first commit, then I should summary my coding life to this point:<br/><br/>
- ***2017-08-20* (LiverStudio to Establish)**<br/>
Establish **LiverStudio** with 1 member (it's me for your concern >.<) with the expectation of releasing 30+ projects named with Liverpool's players. Here is the list and status of them: [LiverStudio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XN6vbJsW4zw5THmVj50cbXyvk0Mu7c9UZGtzwhKGZdQ/edit?usp=sharing)<br/><br/>
- ***2017-A-day-in-July* (Dive into Javascript)**<br/>
After spending hours watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), I got 'something' with Javascript, it liked a little crush and I just want to jump into it. My Javascript started!!!<br/><br/>
- ***2017-A-day-in-April* (Portfolio website)**<br/>
I got rejected every where I applied for a position, I was asking myself many times, why? I had studied hard, worked hard, got certain achievements that my friends had to be jealous. I knew I could learn fast, do multi tasking but how to show it to recruiters when my English was not good enough, there must be a way. That was the time I started making my [portfolio web page](http://stevend.tk/) which the idea came from everything inside a code editor. I am so proud of it, many people liked it, and I got more interview than before.<br/><br/>
- ***Before that***<br/>
There are a lot of things I want to write, but because this is the initial commit, then I leave this blank, but I promise I will be back soon.
