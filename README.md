- **2017-08-27 (initial commit)**  
As being inspired by many people, articles, I decide to write my dairy (mostly coding dairy) which tells about my path full of trouble learning new stuff and to remind me not to forget (give up) the things I could have finished if I have tried a bit more.  
An interesting thing is, with the availability of thousands of tools, webs supporting blog and diary writing, after 1 hour of signing up, trying, my decision is this 'low-level' text file and to make it as normal Git project >.<  
Because this is the first commit, then I should summary my coding life to this point:

- **2017-08-20 (LiverStudio to Establish)**  
Establish **LiverStudio** with 1 member (it's me for your concern >.<) with the expectation of releasing 30+ projects named with Liverpool's players. Here is the list and status of them: [LiverStudio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XN6vbJsW4zw5THmVj50cbXyvk0Mu7c9UZGtzwhKGZdQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- **2017-08-01 ([Javascript Games](https://repl.it/@iamstevendao))**  
From the idea of building a bundle of console on-school games running in Cordova, I started build some easy games by pure Javascript, finished: **[Snake](https://repl.it/Jo5Y/34) [Tank](https://repl.it/Jr4p/1) [FlappyBird](https://repl.it/Jrka/31)** and the most complicated one: **[Pacman](https://repl.it/Jv9c/32)** although I really want to apply [Disktra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to it when I have time.

- **2017-A-day-in-July (Dive into Javascript)**  
After spending hours watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), I got 'something' with Javascript, it liked a little crush and I just want to jump into it. My Javascript started!!!

- **2017-A-day-in-April ([Portfolio](http://stevend.tk/))**  
I got rejected every where I applied for a position, I was asking myself many times, why? I had studied hard, worked hard, got certain achievements that my friends had to be jealous. I knew I could learn fast, do multi tasking but how to show it to recruiters when my English was not good enough, there must be a way. That was the time I started making my [portfolio](http://stevend.tk/) which the idea came from everything inside a code editor. I am so proud of it, many people liked it, and I got more interview than before.

- ***Before that***  
There are a lot of things I want to write, but because this is the initial commit, then I leave this blank, but I promise I will be back soon.
